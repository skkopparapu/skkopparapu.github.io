 EXPERIENCE<BR> 
<DL ><DT><i> 29.07.91 onwards </i>
<DD> Pursuing research in the area of Image
Processing and Computer Vision.  Have developed a framework of modular
integration and multiresolution to solve low-level and high-level vision
problems. Emphasis of the research has been on integrating various modules
that are involved in trying to solve a problem in computer vision.  Also
we have been looking into various problems like stereo vision, optical
flow estimation, color image restoration in a Multiresolution (Image
Pyramid / Wavelet) framework. We have used this developed framework to
successfully extract depth information from stereo pair of images and also
we have been successful in estimating optical flow from temorarly spaced
images.  The developed framework has been successfully tested for scene
interpretation and color image restoration also. Prior to this we worked
on an edge preserving adaptive algorithm for image restoration, the
emphasis here was more on the speed of restoration in terms of time taken
to restore while preserving discontinuities.  In this process I have been
required to conduct simulations for which I have been working on the Linux
(public domain operating system; I was instrumental in installing this
public domain software on the various 386 and 486 platforms available in
the laboratory too.) platform and have extensively used the C language. I
have been on the departmental computer networking committee and am
involved in the maintenance of the machines in the lab in which I work in
the capacity of a systems administrator.

<i> 
Right now we are working on the joint problem of image segmentation and 
image interpretation using the HMM and as a team effort we are working on 
the problem of face identification. </i>
<P>
<DT><i> 04.07.89 - 25.07.91</i>
<DD> Junior Scientific Officer in the Naval
Physical Oceanographic Laboratory - Cochin, sponsored project titled Sonar
System Simulation. Was involved in a group effort to study passive sonar
and write software for target classification in passive sonar environment.
Studied Artificial Neural Networks and successfully used this to classify
sonar targets. Was in this capacity involved in developing software
concerning classification using Neural Networks which was incorporated in
the final module. 
The results were very
encouraging in the sense the performance was far better than the
knowledge based target classification which was done as a part of the 
project earlier. This work resulted in a publication.
<P>
<DT><em> 22.08.88 - 03.07.89 </em>
<DD> Teaching Assistantship at the Regional
Engineering College, Tiruchirapalli, India.  Instructed courses on
Communication theory for the final year and basic electronics for the
second year undergraduate students.  Assisted in conducting basic
electronics laboratory for the second year undergraduate students. 
Instructing courses involved teaching and accessing the students.
