Vision comes to human so naturally that one does not realize its complexity 
until one tries to automate it. The basic aim of stereo vision is to
extract disparity map or equivalently the depth map (provided
the camera geometry is known) of the scene from its two dimensional
 representation [<A HREF="node24.html#ban1">1</A>].
Obtaining depth information from the 2D stereo images is an inverse optics problem
and  hence ill-posed in the 
sense of Hadamard [<A HREF="node24.html#bert">2</A>]. 
Regularization in the sense of Tikhonov is a commonly
used technique in computer vision problems to make an ill-posed   
problem well-posed. The basic philosophy of this  technique  is to restrict the
solution space by imposing some constraints. 
Uniqueness, smoothness, epipolar geometry, disparity gradient, are some of the
physical constraints that are imposed on the stereo problem to restrict the solution
space and hence make the problem well-posed.
<P>
Numerous techniques  have been developed to infer depth ([<A HREF="node24.html#nasa">6</A>]
-[<A HREF="node24.html#marr2">14</A>] to cite a few).
Various shape
from X techniques get the depth information by using only a single 2D 
image, but they make use of a number of assumptions like distant light
sources, spherical patches, knowledge of the reflectance map, etc. In addition,
 the depth information obtained 
is relative and not absolute. Binocular stereo techniques 
use two 
2D images (of the same scene) to extract depth which is absolute.
<P>
Though there exists a large number of stereo vision algorithms, 
most of
them can be categorized as having three main modules built into their structure.
 They are 
 <OL><LI>  Feature Extraction module
<LI>  Matching module
<LI>  Interpolation module
</OL>
<P>
A number of physical constraints are imposed in the development of most 
algorithms. Also, in most of the algorithms the
three blocks are traversed in a top to bottom fashion without
any interaction between the modules.
Initially 
a feature extracting algorithm is used to obtain salient features in both
the left and the right image of the stereo pair. In the second stage, a matching
algorithm is used to match the feature points in the left and the right image. Once the 
feature points are matched, the difference between the position of the feature
point in
the left image and the corresponding matched point in the right image gives the
disparity map. Knowing the geometry of the camera, the depth information
can be calculated from the disparity map in a simple way.
Next an interpolation  algorithm is 
used to interpolate on the sparse depth data, to obtain a  dense depth map
(in our simulations we interpolate on the disparity data rather than the depth
data since the camera geometry is usually not known).

The problem emanating
from large and small number of feature points is pictorially depicted in 
Figure <A HREF="node1.html#STEREO_PROBLEM">1</A>.        
One would like to have a large number of correct matches, leading to a
dense disparity map and consequently to a good reconstruction. But, the dense
depth map and correct matches are conflicting (notice that they appear
on different sides of the matching block in Figure <A HREF="node1.html#STEREO_PROBLEM">1</A>); one alternative
is to use an             integration approach.
Integration is a process
where information obtained from one module drives another 
module with an aim to improve the final solution. A number of algorithms
appear in the vision literature which use integration in one form or another
(for example [<A HREF="node24.html#gamble">3</A>], [<A HREF="node24.html#hwang">4</A>], [<A HREF="node24.html#hoff">5</A>], [<A HREF="node24.html#kana">15</A>], 
[<A HREF="node24.html#ban2">16</A>], [<A HREF="node24.html#bozm">17</A>], [<A HREF="node24.html#clar">24</A>]).
<P>
Perhaps one could view the early work of Moravec [<A HREF="node24.html#mora">18</A>], as an
approach to integrating information from several images of the same 
scene from different views.
More recently Markov Random Field (MRF) framework has been exploited to
integrate information from multiple cues like motion, color, texture
[<A HREF="node24.html#gamble">3</A>]. 
Another approach integrates the stereo pair of images at different
scales, the information available at the coarser pairs is used to aid
the images at finer scales [<A HREF="node24.html#ban2">16</A>]. Integration of stereo
images at various baselines has been worked out in [<A HREF="node24.html#kana">15</A>].
<P>
In this paper, motivated by the work of Gamble et al [<A HREF="node24.html#gamble">3</A>],
Clark and Yullie [<A HREF="node24.html#clar">24</A>], 
Toborg and Hwang [<A HREF="node24.html#hwang">4</A>] and Banard [<A HREF="node24.html#ban2">16</A>] we present a novel approach to    integrate 
various modules associated with stereo. In our approach there is integration among the following
blocks: right and left edge extracting modules, the matching module, and the
interpolator module (see Figure <A HREF="node2.html#INTEGRATION_MODEL">2</A>). We also incorporate line fields to preserve 
discontinuities in the reconstructed surface. Moreover, the interaction between modules is
through these line fields. Our integration approach
results in a disparity map which is dense. 
The computation of dense disparity map from two 2D stereo images is computationally
expensive. 

<P>
To overcome the problem of high computational time we have exploited the 
multiresolution approach of Burt and Adelson [<A HREF="node24.html#burt">23</A>] in our integration
model. We would like to remark that the multiresolution approach of [<A HREF="node24.html#burt">23</A>]
is used very extensively in the computer vision literature
(for example [<A HREF="node24.html#hoff">5</A>], [<A HREF="node24.html#ban2">16</A>], [<A HREF="node24.html#perez">21</A>], [<A HREF="node24.html#dde">22</A>],[<A HREF="node24.html#cochr">25</A>]).
As shown in Section <A HREF="node11.html#secISV">6</A> the multiresolution approach to integrated stereo
is at least seven and a half times faster than the one without multiresolution.
Besides faster computation, our simulation studies illustrate that a more accurate
disparity map is obtained by exploiting multiresolution (see Section <A HREF="node12.html#secexpt">7</A>).
As explained in Section <A HREF="node11.html#secISV">6</A> and <A HREF="node12.html#secexpt">7</A>, this is because, in the
multiresolution approach, we have a better disparity initialization for the
disparity computation at the highest resolution as compared to zero initialization
when one works on the single finest resolution.
