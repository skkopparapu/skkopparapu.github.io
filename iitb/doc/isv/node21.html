Simulations were carried out to validate and justify the use of the proposed algorithm
for obtaining surface description from binocular stereo. One of the main
objective was to show the enhanced performance when various modules are 
integrated.  In addition, we wanted to study the effect of integration 
when a precomputed edge map was used to drive the integration model. 
We also wanted to explore the accuracy of the disparity map and the reduction in
computation when multiresolution approach was used in the stereo algorithm.
<P>
Simulations were carried out on three different pairs of stereo images of
size <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img232.gif">. The first pair is the random dot stereogram (Figure 9 , Figure 10 ),
the two images are identical except for the fact that a small square portion of the 
left image (Figure 9 ) has been shifted by ten pixels to the right and placed in
Figure 10 . The second set (Figure 11 , Figure 12 ) is that of an auto part and the third pair
(Figure 13 , Figure 14 ) is the aerial view of the Pentagon. In all our simulations we make
use of the knowledge of the maximum disparity range in each of the stereo pair
as shown in Table <A HREF="node21.html#tabdisp">1</A>.

Figure 15  through Figure 26  are concerned with the random dot stereogram (Figure 9 , Figure 10 ).
The first set of results (Figure 15  and  Figure 16 ) are obtained when no integration 
is used (Section <A HREF="node14.html#secNI">7.1.1</A>), Figure 15  is the disparity plotted as an intensity map (black
shows zero disparity) and Figure 16  is the disparity plotted as a depth map. The next set of 
results (Figure 17 , Figure 18 ) are the intensity plot and the depth map of the disparity using the
precomputed edge integration model of Figure <A HREF="node15.html#figprecomputed">7</A>. Figure 19  and  Figure 20  are obtained using the 
interactive edge integration model of 
Figure <A HREF="node16.html#figestimated">8</A>. Figure 21  is the intensity plot of the disparity and Figure 22  is the depth plot
of the disparity using the general stereo integration model of Figure <A HREF="node2.html#INTEGRATION_MODEL">2</A>. Figure 23  - Figure 26  are obtained
using the multiresolution technique. Figure 23  and  Figure 24  are the disparity plotted as an intensity map
and disparity plotted as  depth for the case where only precomputed edges are used along
with multiresolution,
(Section <A HREF="node19.html#secMPE">7.2.1</A>). Figure 25  and Figure 26 \
 are obtained using interactive edge computation along with multiresolution (Section <A HREF="node20.html#secMIE">7.2.2</A>).
<P>
Figure 27  through Figure 38  and Figure 39  through Figure 50  
depict the results of various experiments using the auto part stereo pair and 
the Pentagon stereo pair, respectively. The sequence of operations is the same
as that depicted for the random dot stereogram and this follows the sequence of
subsections and sub-subsections of Section <A HREF="node12.html#secexpt">7</A>. This sequence is, no integration,
only precomputed edges, interactive edge computation, precomputed edges and interactive
edge computation, only precomputed edged using multiresolution, and interactive edges
using multiresolution. In each case the intensity disparity map as well as
3D display of the disparity map are shown.
<P>
In all our simulations the number of integrated iterations was fixed at <b>200</b> for the 
monoresolution case and <b>20</b> for the multiresolution case. The value of the
threshold in (<A HREF="node11.html#eqdiff_2_lf">6</A>) was set to <b>20</b>.
<P>
The parameter values are shown in  Table <A HREF="node21.html#tabparameter">2</A>. Those
that are not shown (i.e <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img234.gif">, <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img235.gif">, <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img236.gif">, <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img237.gif">) take a
value 1. The value of the parameters in the case of multiresolution was kept
identical over all resolutions.
