A speech signal (Figure <A HREF="node2.html#speech">1(a)</A>) is a  pressure wave that travels from a
speaker to the listener[<A
 HREF="node8.html#rabiner">5</A>].  
This signal essentially consists of variation in
pressure as a function of time. The amplitude variations of such a signal
correspond to deviations from atmospheric pressure caused by the 
traveling waves.
The main organs of the human body responsible for producing speech are the
lungs, larynx, pharynx, nose and various parts of the mouth. Muscular force to
expel air from the lungs provides the source of energy. The air flow is
modulated in various ways to produce components of acoustic power in the audio
frequency range. The properties of the resultant sound are modified by the rest
of the vocal organs to produce speech. 

<P>
The process of acoustic resonance is of prime importance in determining the
properties of speech sounds. The vocal tract, that starts at the larynx and
extends up through the pharynx and mouth to the lips, is the principal resonant
structure. For some sounds the nose is also coupled in to make a more
complicated resonant system.
The frequencies of the resonance and
the way they change with time are crucial in determining what is being said.
The main resonance modes of the vocal tract are known as formants, and by
convention they are numbered from the low-frequency end. They are usually
referred to as F1, F2, F3, etc. In general F1 and F2 (normally in the range 250
Hz to 3 KHz) are the most significant in determining the phonetic properties of
speech sounds.
frequencies are often considered as the elements of the feature vector, which
characterizes the speech signal.

<P>
A short-time Fourier
transform (STFT) of a speech signal gives the spectral representation of a
speech signal. The spectrum gives a picture of the distribution of frequency
and amplitude at a moment in time. 
The formants are best visualized in the spectral domain as spectral peaks.
Fourier analysis done over successive overlapping blocks of the speech signal
generates a three-dimensional plot called the spectrogram (see Figure
<A HREF="node2.html#orig">1(b)</A>). The x-axis 
of the spectrogram represents time, the
y-axis represents the spectral content (frequency),
 and the z-axis representing the spectral energy forming the three dimensions.

<P>
A <EM> spectrogram</EM> of the speech signal (Fig. <A HREF="node2.html#speech">1(a)</A>) is shown in
Fig. <A HREF="node2.html#orig">1(b)</A>. In essence, it is a projection of the 
three-dimensional Fourier plot
onto the image plane. The spectrogram shows intensity variations, ranging
from dark to shades of gray colour, which reflect the energies of
the different frequencies occurring in the speech signal. The dark areas
correspond to higher spectral energies 
are the formants, while the lighter areas denote lower spectral energy. 
The
formants show a regular connected band like structure, because the human
speech articulatory system is limited by certain physical constraints,
which restrict the way the formants change, both over time and in
frequency [<A
 HREF="node8.html#zue">8</A>].  
For this reason, we believe that the spectrogram has visual cues which 
can be used effectively to
extract and track formants. 

<P>
In this paper, we take the 
spectrogram of the speech signal, represented as a 8-bit gray scale image, 
as the input to our formant extraction and tracking technique.
