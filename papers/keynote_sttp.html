<h1> Inagural Talk </h1>


<p>
I am sure this is going to be an interesting and informative training
programme. I observe from the schedule that the organizing committee has put in
a whole lot of effort to bring to the training a healthy mix of talks on
fundamentals, applications in IP and MM, more importantly a significant amount
of time has been alloted to demonstrations and hands on experience which I am
sure the participants will enjoy. This will also help the participants to see
into theory.
<p>
IP and MM have been researched for a while now - even after so many years there
is something novel about it that it still gets researchers attention. Slowly we
are seeing IP being used albiet not to its full potential in various walks of
life - the x-ray baggage scanner at the aiport shows off the image capturing
process but probably lacks an utomatic process to detect known unacceptable
material - probably it is the combination of technology gap and the need for a
0% tolerence. But the difference between theory and usability of theory in
practise is what keeps the field fertile and interesting.
<p>
Wish you all a great learning!
