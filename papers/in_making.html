<h1>Brewing Ideas</h1>

<ul>

<li> Ideas
<ol>
<li> [201206; Speech] Use the FM radio this day in the past for language change
detection and things like that.
<li> [201206; Speech] Use the AIR FM radio news plus accurate transcripts for (a) identifying
the headlines and the complete story. We should be able to create hyperlinks
into the audio file so that when one clicks on the headlines one can go and
hear the audio corresponding to the headlines.
<li> [20101004;NLP]: Given a conference schedule (assuming that you have a list of
selected paper titles and authors and affliation) can we automatically identify infocus
areas or research? Given two three years of these details - can one
automatically gauge what research is dead, what is active and hot? What other
information can one give? Which university is active? Which area is active?
Which country is active? Is there someone doing work that might be of interest to
other country? Who is collaborating with whom? Author linkages; country
linkages? Can we compare two conferences which are based on the same theme?
(<i>Idea based on <a href="http://nsh.nexiwave.com/2010/10/reading-interspeech-2010-program.html">Blog</a></i>)
<li> [20101004;NLP]: Information extraction from noisy crowd-sourced data. In a Web 2.0
platform like IdeaMAX several ideas are posted and discussed. Can we analyze
this crowd sourced data (typically noisy) to get what the idea is about? Can we
also suggest who in the crowd should be tagged as an inventor if the idea were
to be patented? (<i>Idea based on IdeaMAX discussion internally in TCS</i>)

<li> [20110114;NL]: Given a set of product reviews (<a
href="http://www.mouthshut.com/product-reviews/Advice-on-Induction-Cookers-925062280-sort-AvgRating-order-d">Example</a>)
can we summarize the reviews? Can we give an automatic advise based on these
reviews? Can we relatively rank the reviews in terms of "for" and "against" and
inbetween? Can we give a recommendation like buy or no buy?

<li> <s>[20101004;IP]: How do we display an image to a visually challenged person?
This is a challenge especially since what is interpreted by an individual is
what is seen in an image. At one extreme is that each pixel gets a discription
and at the othere extreme is the who image ha—ï one description. The answer
proably lies some where in between. The idea is to have several levels of
description from the full image to the pixel which are linked up in a certain
way. Once this description is organized; allows the visually challenged person
to access the description. Say when (s)he puts the mouse at one point - there
is a description at a level and as the track button is moved the description
goes on getteing refined until there is a description of that pixel. Two
challenges (a) developing the annotation of this photograph and (b) building a
user interface to read the image. (<i>Idea no reference!</i>) </s> <b>Patented and
