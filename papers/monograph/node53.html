Obtaining the Conditionals</A>
</H2>
The method 
requires the specification of the conditional probabilities 
of features
given the 
interpretations. This was done by considering only the class of aerial images
and the objects identifiable from the air. Hence, the conditional probabilities
were determined 
heuristically by studying an aerial image for the following objects: 
<EM>road, grassland, 
foliage, vehicle (car), building, <EM>and</EM> shadow</EM>. Note that
the conditionals were extracted from a part of the image that was not subject
to interpretation. 
After the image had been segmented manually, several blocks of
size  were placed randomly all over the image 
such that each block would lie completely
in one segment. For each block the 
average gray level,  average texture density
and the number of pixels of the 
block that did not figure in any other previously
visited block were computed. 
For each identifiable object (or each pair of objects in
case of contrast) in the image an histogram
was prepared with the feature level on the 
horizontal axis and the frequency of occurrence
of the feature level (taken to be the 
number of blocks that showed up that feature value) 
for that object on the vertical axis. To represent the 
conditional distributions for average gray level
the gray levels considered were discretized 
conveniently. It was found using the 
interactive image processing software that the images
had gray levels only in certain narrow regions. 
Consequently  the range over which gray levels
were to be found was discretized into a number of levels 
( for the case of the image in Figure <A HREF="node53.html#fig61">4.4</A>). 
This was also done for the case of texture and 
area levels ( and  
levels respectively for the case of the image in Figure <A HREF="node53.html#fig61">4.4</A>). 
This histogram was used as an approximation for 
our conditional distribution of features given the interpretations.
Since several feature values threw up the value of zero 
(which is inadmissible in the 
conditionals of a Bayesian network) we pegged small 
values to the histogram for all these 
features and normalized the entire histogram to obtain our 
operational conditional pdf. 
Some of the histograms that were 
obtained for the image in Figure <A HREF="node53.html#fig61">4.4</A> are shown
in Figure <A HREF="node53.html#fig60">4.3</A>. They are self explanatory.

<P>
Only a small portion of the test image was actually subject to the interpretation scheme.
The image in Figure <A HREF="node53.html#fig61">4.4</A> (a) has all  the objects except the river that we set out to identify. 
The image of Figure <A HREF="node53.html#fig61">4.4</A> (b) has 16 segments and it can be seen that the method has identified 
all the segments correctly (Figure <A HREF="node53.html#fig61">4.4</A> (c)).
