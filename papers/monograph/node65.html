Conclusions
</H1>

<P>
The applicability of the proposed modular integration and 
multiresolution
for the high-level vision task of image interpretation has been
demonstrated by proposing a joint segmentation and image interpretation
scheme. The proposed scheme has been tested on both indoor and outdoor
real images and it is found that the scheme is not only capable of
interpreting the segments correctly but also is able to produce a good
segmented image. The main reason for the good performance (in terms of 
correct interpretation) of the
proposed scheme lies in the synergistic integration of the segmentation 
and the interpretation  modules. 
This
supports the belief 
that integration of different 
modules is very useful.

<P>
The use of multiresolution for joint segmentation and image interpretation
has the following advantages: 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>the difference image which results 
as an outcome of multiresolution pyramid, 
is used to refine the k-means
segmented image (See Figure <A HREF="node58.html#fig:explain">5.3</A> part d), 
</LI>
<LI>it reduces the
computational time 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>by using the interpretation labels
estimated at
coarse resolution to initialize the interpretation labels at fine
resolution and thus reducing the number of iteration for the
interpretation module to converge, and
</LI>
<LI>by actually requiring the
interpretation to be carried out on  of the total number of pixels of
the image to be interpreted. In all our experiments we found that stopping
the interpretation at one resolution below the finest resolution, namely
stopping at resolution , did not effect the interpretation
results.

an insight on how pyramids of non-octave pyramid, non-octave

<LI>Building a knowledge base is an important aspect of image
interpretation and needs to be explored. One could possibly generate
knowledge by constructing conditional probabilities from the test images
and use the resultant density functions instead of what is shown in
Figures <A HREF="node31.html#fig:basis_function">3.3</A> or <A HREF="node31.html#fig:appen_cost">3.4</A> as the basis
function. Figure <A HREF="node65.html#fig:test_basis">5.11</A> gives a sample plot of one such
basis function. The <IMG
 WIDTH="78" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img41.gif"
 ALT="$x$"> - axis is the feature value (in this case it is
the gray level value) and  - axis shows the normalized frequency of
occurrence of gray level subtracted from .  This would be more realistic
than the presently used linear basis function basis function,
linear (Figure
<A HREF="node31.html#fig:basis_function">3.3</A>). The other possibility is to
design a neural network to derive knowledge. One could also think in 
terms of integrating the knowledge base module into the interpretation 
system.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Build some amount of user interactibility into the 
interpretation scheme. The interactibility may prove useful in the
segmentation stage, since it is well known that no known segmentation
scheme exist that can give a <EM>good</EM> segmentation in all parts of the
image. User interactibility would enhance the overall performance of the
proposed joint segmentation and image interpretation scheme. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Some study is called for to decide on how the features should be
chosen. This study would come in handy and would provide guidelines as to
the choice of the features. The choice of the features would invariably 
depend on some a priori knowledge that the user has about the scene to be 
interpreted.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>One could think of using an additional cue in the form of color to
enhance the interpretation scheme [<A
 HREF="node80.html#bk_Ohta_85">2</A>]. The other effort
could go towards construction of a single energy function which would do
both segmentation and image interpretation similar to [<A
 HREF="node80.html#jr_Kim_95">72</A>],
but in a multiresolution framework. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>One major drawback of the image interpretation scheme is the
inherent assumption that one makes when choosing the features. The
strongest one being that the details of the scene are <EM>known</EM> even
before the proposed algorithm is put to test, meaning we are a priori
aware as to what to expect from the scene. This is in some sense
constraining the algorithm by telling it what to expect in the scene. One
should think of schemes which either integrate these constraints into the
knowledge base or possibly take care by some other means. Even a small
breakthrough in this path will be a good contribution.
