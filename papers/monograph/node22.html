Multiresolution
</H1>

<P>
The multiresolution idea of looking at signals and analyzing them
at various scales or resolutions has received enormous attention in
the field of computer vision. Multiresolution is a mode of efficiently and
effectively representing the data with an objective of reducing the
computational complexity. Multiresolution can be thought of as a data
structuredata structure which produces a successive condensed
representation of the information in a given image.  The data at each
resolution is the output of a bandpass filterbandpass filter with
some centre frequency, usually the centre frequency of the filters are
octave apart. 
 The most obvious advantage of this type of representation is that they
provide a possibility for reducing computational cost of various image
operations. The reduction in the computational cost is due to the fact
that when we operate in a multiresolution framework, we operate on 
data from the coarse to the fine resolution.
 The result of going through such a procedure is that, at the finest
resolution we start off with a fairly good guess of the solution, the
guess having come from the immediate coarse resolution and hence we need
less time to reach the solution. One does indeed need to start with an
arbitrary guess at the coarsest resolution, but at that resolution the
amount of data one is operating on is many orders of magnitude less than
that at the finest resolution.

In multiresolution representation, the problem of solving the vision task

passing the variables of interest from coarse to fine resolution.  The
motivation to use multiresolution in vision task comes from: 

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Vision tasks are usually computationally intensive and there is a 
need to reduce its computational complexity,

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Most of the vision tasks are motivated by the functioning of 
HVS and the HVS uses multiresolution [<A
 HREF="node80.html#bk_Scha_89">1</A>]. Experimental 
results show that a multifrequency channel decomposition
seems to be taking place in the human visual cortexhuman visual 
cortex [<A
 HREF="node80.html#jr_Mall_89">94</A>]. 
Experiments based on adaptation techniques show that at some stage in the
HVS, the visual information in different frequency bands is processed   
separately. Experiments also show that the retina image 
is decomposed into several frequency bands, each having 
approximately the same
bandwidth on an octave scale.

There exists two predominant ways of constructing multiscale 
representationsmultiscale representations using
multiscale filtering: (i) GaussianGaussian pyramid 
and Laplacian pyramidsLaplacian pyramid
proposed by Burt and Adelson [<A
 HREF="node80.html#jr_Burt_83">95</A>] 
and (ii) the wavelet
pyramids [<A
 HREF="node80.html#jr_Mall_89">94</A>]. Both these assume 
that the image size be a power of
<IMG
 WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img147.gif"
 ALT="$2$"> (see Appendix <A HREF="node69.html#chap:custom_made_pyramid">D</A> for discussion on 
custom made
pyramids). Gaussian pyramids are obtained by smoothening 
brightness 
values over larger areas producing a set of low pass filtered copy
of the original image and Laplacian pyramids are obtained by
differentiating smoothed brightness values producing a set of bandpass
filtered copy of the original image (see Figure 
<A HREF="node23.html#fig:gaussian_procedure">2.2</A>).
The wavelet pyramids are constructed by low pass filtering and high pass
filtering the image along the rows and then along the columns to produce
four quadrants  (<!-- MATH
 $\stackrel{\fbox{1}\fbox{2}}{\fbox{3}\fbox{4}}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="106" HEIGHT="38" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img148.gif"
 ALT="$ \stackrel{\fbox{1}\fbox{2}}{\fbox{3}\fbox{4}}$">,
Figure <A HREF="node24.html#fig:wt_construct">2.5</A>) such that the first quadrant is low
pass filtered along both the rows and columns of the image, 
the second quadrant is low low pass filter high pass filter
pass filtered along the rows and high pass filtered along the columns, the
third quadrant is high pass filtered along the rows and low pass filtered
along the columns and finally the fourth quadrant is high pass filtered
along both rows and columns. The filter coefficients are determined from a
set of four linear equations obtained as a consequence of the constraints
placed on the coefficients of the filter [<A
 HREF="node80.html#bk_Daub_92">96</A>]. 

<P>
Nevertheless the wavelet representationwavelet representation of
the image is more compact in the sense, the lattice size does not
increase. The wavelet transform of an image of size <!-- MATH

2^\Omega$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img149.gif"

2^\Omega$"> is again an image of size <!-- MATH
 $2^\Omega \times 2^\Omega$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img149.gif"
 ALT="$2^\Omega \times
2^\Omega$"> where as the
Gaussian pyramid when constructed as suggested in [<A
 HREF="node80.html#jr_Burt_83">95</A>] would
end up with a larger number of data points [<A
 HREF="node80.html#jr_Mall_89">94</A>].
