Guruji tried hard to salvage Mr. Hari-Das, but to no avail --  everyone said
that he had Permanently head Damaged himself and was beyond repair. But
to everyone's surprise Hari-Das was awarded a place in-midst of the
distinguished few, who had Ph.D. and was granted
permission to Permanently head Damage others, but at a different place,
because they said they did not like people damaging others head in a
place where they themselves had damaged theirs!

<P>
Having damaged Hari-Das and having nothing else to do the Guruji was in
search of another Hari-Das, this time the search was a little more
difficult (actually the search was becoming difficult day by day) because
there was a strong lobby in the world machine called the IT  industry which was
snatching away all HD's as soon as they were ready and in market. 

<P>
One fine morning to the utter surprise of guruji there stood a potential
HD right in front of him. Guruji set his timer and let his HD_test
algorithm run and quickly analyzed the returned data and found Hari-Das to
be fit, now he was sure that his algorithm would work, because he had gone
over the source code carefully and compiled it with extreme care,
debugging even the tiniest of his routines with infinitesimal care; but
then like any <EM>good</EM> programmer he was not very sure if there would be any
runtime errors or errors in the form of overflow or data underflow, either
way there was nothing much he could do about this, because its dependence was
more on the 
bits of data in HD. Guruji carefully looked at the bytes of data in
Hari-Das and did not see anything unusual and so rubbed into his RAM that
the program would complete in 5 years if not earlier and prayed that there
be no core dumps or segmentation faults because he was afraid that he
would have to debug his code all over again and this meant that his years
of research in permanently head damaging others wasted. 

<P>
Guruji already
in  midst of a sponsored project, could afford to purchase HD for his 
machine with no warranty. HD was smaller than the former PhD HD, the reason 
was the growing technology<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="#foot9"><SUP>2</SUP></A>! and so there was some adjustments that had
to be done to fit him into the slot vacated by the former HD, now proudly
calling himself Dr. HD. Thought HD was very comfortable he felt that he
was out of place with all those tiny chips and add-on cards surrounding
him --  but then he held a special place in the machine and hence held his 
cool which came from the fan that came attached to him.

<P>
Guruji was not really concerned if the slot that HD occupied was
comfortable enough or not; he had paid for HD from under his nose and
wanted to get started immediately and fresh. He called HD and wanted to
reformat him to initialize him 
 to the tune of his place, this meant loss of the
earlier data but then the algorithm developed by guruji worked right from
this basic (read it fundamental) step! Guruji went ahead with the
reformatting knowing very well that HD came formatted a priori and that too
with enough data and information; but then he decided to go ahead with the
reformatting because that way the program would complete in the forecasted 5
years.

<P>
Initially, he low level formatted HD, at first it was bit by bit and then
it was byte by byte. Everything seemed to be going on well, but under the
microscopic eyes of guruji there were some errors in aligning bits and the
only routine that was available was to reformat again from scratch. With
this, things were all set for guruji and he hoped that everything would
work well ...

<P>
As all new brooms sweep well (all thought so) HD started off well and
guruji was happy with the performance. The data never got corrupted and
guruji was happy with the amount of data that HD could hold; it was really
amazing considering the fact that it was so small compared to the earlier
permanently head damaged HD. Hari-Das worked faithfully keeping track of
every bit and byte over all sectors and in all cylinders, seeing every
program go by becoming a master by themselves. HD was patient and never
lost his cool thought he was tested by many of the programs that later
became masters. Guruji was too happy with the performance of Hari-Das for
the simple reason that he did not have to spend enough time with HD
and was getting the required performance. 
Things seem to go on well ever since the new HD occupied that
slot vacated by the senior Permanently head Damaged HD. HD worked
faithfully and guruji was more than happy with the buy. HD worked to a
predefined plan and was running to a preset calendar like a half asleep
always awake cron daemon -- this pleased the guruji even more because in
some sense his 5 year program had automated itself and he was sure it
would work without his involvement. Very occasionally Hari-Das would
giveaway and almost always he would revive himself without any external
help, once in a while it would be those master programs or those smaller
programs that would cause some problems in the form of disturbance that
would disturb the power supply, this, guruji would immediately fix,
without much effort and without requiring any external help; at other
times it was some of the memory chips that would be overworked -- 
this guruji would easily find and rectify in a jiffy. HD worked hard and
people thought that he was likely to damage himself but then the guruji
did not think so -- he always felt that HD had not damaged himself
yet<A NAME="tex2html3"
  HREF="#foot10"><SUP>3</SUP></A> or reached anywhere near being called
permanently head damaged! So HD was not thrown out, instead it was kept in
its original place but with some additional support. HD was doing his work
but at a reduced pace but now he was quite accustomed to his surroundings
-- he has seen so many chips and cards come in and go out and after a while
he found that he was the senior most in his domain this set him rotating
faster and erratically than ever before. He churned out data at a rate
which he was capable of, but could not all these days, because of the
limitations imposed by the chips and the cards with whom he had had to
work, but now he cared less  for them and more for himself and hence 
rotated at his own pace. But
since he was getting old he did not notice that he was slowly damaging
himself, but there were a couple of other master guruji's who wanted him
out since they found that Hari-Das had sufficiently damaged his head by
working on the program (which he had done well) and so they allowed him
to churn out data at the rate he wished so that he could damage himself faster.

<P>
Guruji sensed that Hari-Das was going to damage himself one of these
days and would have to be thrown out as a PhD, so he was in search for a
new HD candidate who would eventually take over the slot of Hari-Das -- in
brief he was already on the lookout for a new HD so that the transition
from Hari-Das to new HD would not be difficult for the other chips and
cards to bear. So, he sent in information to all the vendors informing
them that he was in search of a new HD, a couple of quotations came but
eventually he had to buy from a person who had fixed a rate contract with
the boss of guruji. Thus one bright Wednesday morning a slim, slender
beauty with a couple of gigabytes
of brains walked into his study and introduced
herself as Harika-Dubey. Ms HD was of a new generation - a beauty with
brains sort of stuff.

<P>
Since Hari-Das was to be thrown out soon and since there could not be a
transition that spiky because this would effect the chips and the on board
cards in addition to the chips sitting on the motherboard,
 Hari-Das and Harika-Dubey were put
together and they worked in the master master mode though they were a
generation apart. They were a perfect team syncing smoothly and working
well as a team transferring data with ease between them in bits and bytes
over a million times again and again. With in a few hours they were so
accustomed to each other that they felt that they were transferring data
since ages. But a generation gap did take its toll; neither did Hari-Das
tell nor Harika-Dubey realize that though they're working together they
were not syncing as they should and that this nano second out of  
sync would cause
problems later. The hitch was that Harika-Dubey was from a new generation
and hence was much faster at churning out data compared to Hari-Das, but  the
older generation HD
stretched himself to the limit and
worked as hard as Harika-Dubey and erased the generation gap that had crept
up. But then a generation gap is a gap whether one likes it or not so this
had its effect on the old generation 
Hari-Das who was overworking himself and in this
process was damaging himself. Then the ultimate had to occur and one fine
Friday afternoon his guruji and a group of distinguished head damaged
people who had helped Hari-Das damage his head proclaimed him Permanently
head Damaged. This meant that he would be thrown out of the machine 
soon and in the mean
time he took time off to transfer all the data that he had accumulated
over years to Harika-Dubey again bit by bit doing a CRC check as he
transferred. All his data was gracefully accepted and she had enough space
left after the Megabytes of data transfer. Harika-Dubey to everyone's
dismay was happy that Hari-Das had damaged his head but then was sad that
Hari-Das had to leave and felt that the slot vacated by him could not be
filled by any other person either from the next generation or as a matter
of fact from her own generation.

<P>
Once out of the machine where he had a good friend in Harika-Dubey, Hari-Das
was in search for a new machine that could afford him and supply him power
so that he could work and perform all his program ideas, so in search of a nice
machine he traveled from workstation's to laptop's. He found that though
all the machines found him interesting and appreciated him though he had
damaged his head with a PhD.
But no one came forward to accept him and offer him a
power supply, which was to him his life jacket so that he could churn some
special data. Dejected he offered himself on a global basis and to his
surprise he, the damaged one, was acceptable by a couple of machines
overseas to churn data. He transported himself to
that place  and found a nice little slot on board in that
remote machine. There the neighborhood was quite vast and he found lot of
slots near him. He instantaneously set to work and soon established link
with guruji's machine and was in touch with Harika-Dubey over the fast link
on the internet -- they exchanged news via the email and when required
talked by starting a chat session over the net. This was a new experience
to both of them, they felt so near to each other though they were a sea
apart. This experience sent both of them mad with excitement and started
churning out data impatiently at the unbelievable speed of light assuming
that there was a optical link in midst them! This led to Premature head
damage of Harika-Dubey and also to a repeat head damage of Hari-Das, but
this time he was proclaimed as a bigger head damaged person and was
honored and placed in the distinguished list of even fewer PhD. Hari-Das
returned home after damaging his head for the second time to the warm
welcome of all the machines - they said once head damaged is bad but a
double damage to head especially overseas was acceptable because it was
proved that here would be no further head damage.  Hari-Das though not very
happy with this did not complain. Hari-Das obtained a neat slot in one of
the finest machines and Harika-Dubey too was warmly welcomed by the
machine, half because she was good enough for that machine and secondly
because they felt that she would make a good team with the double head
damaged Hari-Das since they had previously worked together as a good team
sharing bits and bytes with out any CRC errors. Thus both Hari-Das and
Harika-Dubey came together again and they lived ever happily sharing bits
and bytes.
