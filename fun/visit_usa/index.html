<P>
A lady comes asking <EM>"I can not find my flight details on the TV
screen showing other flight details and departure gate information"</EM> to
one of those numerous 'checking' personnels. <EM>"Please check your
ticket and check again on the TV screen",</EM> he says calmly in turn. The
lady has obviously done that and say she just did that, but was not able
to spot her flight on the ever changing information the TV screen but says
that she was told that her flight would depart from gate E23. Then he
says<EM>"Then madam you look for the signs and then go to E23 and there
you can look for the flight details in the TV screen"</EM>. My flight NW0061
to New York is being announce and I depart quite amused by the
conversation that happened in front of me.

<P>
In India - the 'checking' guy would have literally led her to the
departure gate. <EM>"This way madam, I can help you with the luggage
etc..."</EM>. But the point I could not fathom is what if that lady went to
gate E23 and did not find details about her flight? Back to the square
one. Did anyone say every things should have an end?!

September 22, 2002, NW0061 Amsterdam to New York - 1535</A>
</H2>

<P>
I am inside the gate waiting to board NW0061. Expecting an announcement asking
people to board the aircraft and lo comes the announcement "Technical Snag",
unknown delay, please cooperate! A couple of minutes before this I had seen a
bag being carried by a boy which had the caption "IT happens only in Indya" - I
laughed - it happens everywhere. Somehow I had a feeling that things might not
go wrong in European countries - wrong. Murphy you are always right. After 40
minutes or so another announcement - "the leaking water problem has been fixed"
- now boarding. Everyone settles into their seats and the 747-400 is taxied
out. Suddenly someone notices water leak - oops it has not yet been fixed
properly! - turn around - back to the airport gate. Four technicians and four
helpers and after 2 hours the flight finally takes off. I have filled the I-94
form required to enter USA along with customs form. My immediate thought -
will I get enough time to catch the connecting flight from New York to Detroit?
I mean I have to collect my luggage and the recheck it into the domestic
flight from New York to Detroit. Does a water leak take so much time to fix?
Boeing is a Boeing everywhere - in India would they have taken more time to fix
it - I will never know - do I really care?

</H2>
Everyone is settled into their seats - traveling economy is not very
comfortable though especially if you are built big. The announcement " door
closed - this flight to Detroit ....". Suddenly one man starts jogging with is
bag to the front of the aircraft - literally everyone in the aircraft freezes -
after a couple of seconds he returns back -- everyone sigh a sign of relief.
As the man walks by - everyone is giggling and laughing - the man surely
embrassed. The man apparently wanted to go to Kansas and this was not announced
- the flight was apparently going to Kansas after a brief halt at Detroit! Wow
- things happen and there is a real scare when unexpected things happen.

<P>
"Refresh Renergise" the video program on the NW flight said. That is
interesting I thought - the video comes on with 3 ladies sitting comfortably -
relaxing their limbs, delicately and video attractively - I have seen this
video before in other NW flights - but I did not pay much attention -
traveling back home I am more relaxed and less anxious - I feel something is
not very proper. Well, I am in the economy class and the video shows the
business class seating. Ladies can you please show me how one can do those
delicate limb movements to relax in an economy class setup. Sir the video is
for business class passengers I am told - then what is the point showing it to
the cattle class passengers? No motives -- please get yourself a business
class ticket next time.

October 1, 2002, Amsterdam to Mumbai</A>
</H2>

<P>
Plane size is constant in the direction showing map inside the aircraft - say at
a certain resolution the "plane" is covering whole of India! Pity! Well another
thing, I did not know that Bombay (announcement), Calcutta, Madras  existed
since their names were changed to Mumbai, Kolkotta and Chennai a while ago --
well, they still exist on NW flights.
