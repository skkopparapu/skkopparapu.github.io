IC 273 from Calcutta, scheduled 2050, expected 2320, status provisional
the board with large display greeted me when I arrived at the Santa Cruz
domestic airport in Mumbai. Earlier traveling by the BEST bus I had missed
the airport stop because the brightly lit name plate atop the domestic
airport had read Chakrapathi Shivaji International Airport -- my little
brain had decided that an international airport can not be the domestic,
airport - once again my silly brain had erred. Two stop away from where I
should have alighted I hurriedly got down and retraced the 2 bus stops
back to the international airport along the busy highway. Although the
highway was traffic rich -- the cool breeze made the walk pleasant and
probably next time I have to go the airport and have the time to spare it
will be three bus stops away trek to the airport -- it is a great
experience walking along the highway and I bet not many of us get an
opportunity especially in these days where we like to zoom in a new car.

<P>
Unmindful of the traffic there are three women stringing flowers to make a
garland of flowers and a few paces away there is a couple sharing a cup of
romantic tea in a makeshift tea stall -- life goes on. As I walk past the
women stringing the flowers an aeroplane takes off from the nearby airport
with disturbing noise level -- I have traveled by an aeroplane but have
not seen an aeroplane fly so low. I look up and admire the sight - it is
an Indian Airlines craft the bright white pattern of IA on a red
background giving away its identity -- the women don't seem to show any
interest -- for them what matters is probably stringing the flowers that
probably will fetch them resources to fill their stomach or is it that
they have seen very many aeroplane fly that low -- I am not sure.

<P>
I hurry to the airport which is not yet in sight. I reach the airport and
to my disappointment I find that I will meeting Namita much later than
expected for her flight IC 273 is delayed -- Oh no not again I exclaim to
myself. How can aircrafts be delayed everyday or is it only on those days
when I am expecting someone or someone is expecting me? My luck can not be
all that bad, probably this happens all the time, everyday. What ever the
thing I don't like it and my mind drifts to precisely a fortnight ago when
I was almost made the CEO of Indian Airlines! I wish I was; probably then
I could manage to reach the aircrafts in time to their destinations - if
not I would set myself the task of achieving on-time arrival of all
aircraft at least once a week -- well if I am earning a CEO's salary;
this is but a minor aspect of the job that the people flying my aircraft
nd the people awaiting their near and dear ones in the airports would
expect of me.

<P>
Rewind a fortnight; there I am in Calcutta dreaming Bangalore my
destination -- as usual the aircraft is late and unfortunately it is
again the Indian Airlines flight IC xyz (doesn't matter every IC flight
seems to be delayed!). As usual I ask for the aisle seat with the
assumption that at least at the destination I can hurry out of the
aircraft and reach where I should have been an hour (at the minimum) ago.
My tired eyes notice that the window seat in my row is unoccupied and
vacant -- uhmm, a more delayed passenger in an already delayed flight
wow! My half drowsy eyes spot a gentleman in his late forties, dark and
stout hurrying into the aircraft and immediately I am able to correlate
the vacant seat to him and am preparing to unbuckle my seat belt to allow
him to his designated seat when the gentleman asks me to shift my place so
that he can occupy the aisle seat -- the reason he wants to keep his
biggish luggage in the aisle - I am taken by surprise because every
airlines that I have traveled never allow the aisle to be blocked under
any circumstances and in the calmest voice possible tell him "I suppose
they will object to you keeping your baggage in the aisle" and before I
complete "and I also asked for this aisle seat" he shows his annoyance and
is angry and shoots back "You are talking as if you are the CEO of Indian
Airlines". I am a bit confused and shocked and can not believe that he is
being rude to me -- probably he had a bad day and I flamed up his ego by
suggesting that he can not keep his baggage in the aisle. Well, delayed
flights don't make you calmer and so I say "Yes one day I will certainly
become the CEO of Indian Airlines and probably you will miss your flight
if you arrive late like today". We calm down and the rest of the journey
is uneventful. This sets me thinking -- will people appreciate if the
flights are on time every time? Or will they curse for missing the flights
-- am not sure, but we need to change our frame of mind. "They have
invited us at 730pm so we should reach there after 8pm" seems to be the
general thinking - will we change?

<P>
The large display board in front of me changes; IC 273 from Calcutta,
scheduled 2050, expected 2355, status expected. Some relief, at least the
aircraft is coming today - so what if it is delayed by 185 minutes. Well
haven't I wasted 185 minutes before, probably I have probably I haven't
-- but I fail to image all the 250 odd passengers of that IC 273 loosing
out on 185 minutes! That is a huge lost man hours and this for s single
flight -- this is not good -- and yes one day I want to be the CEO of
the Indian Airlines and you know what my challenge would be, don't you?
